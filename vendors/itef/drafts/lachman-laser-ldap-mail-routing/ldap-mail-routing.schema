# Abstract
#
#    This document defines an LDAP [1] object class called
#    'inetLocalMailRecipient' and associated attributes that provide a way
#    to designate an LDAP entry as one that represents a local (intra-
#    organizational) email recipient, to specify the recipient's email
#    address(es), and to provide routing information pertinent to the
#    recipient.  This is intended to support SMTP [2] message transfer
#    agents in routing RFC 822-based email [3] within a private enterprise
#    only, and is not to be used in the process of routing email across
#    the public Internet.
#
#  4.2  Address Attribute
#
attributetype ( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.13
           NAME 'mailLocalAddress'
           DESC 'RFC 822 email address of this recipient'
           EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
           SYNTAX '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26{256}'
       )
#
#    The 'mailLocalAddress' attribute is used to specify email addresses,
#    for the recipient; for example, "nickname@example.com".  The address
#    conforms to the syntax of an 'addr-spec' as defined in [3].
#
#    The 'mailLocalAddress' attribute MUST contain all local addresses
#    that represent each recipient of the target MTA.  Commonly, the value
#    of the 'mail' attribute should also be among the addresses listed in
#    the 'mailLocalAddress' attribute if it is expected to be used for
#    LDAP mail routing.
#
#    When determining the disposition of a given message, MTAs using LDAP
#    (directly or indirectly) to route mail MUST search for an entry with
#    object class 'inetLocalMailRecipient' and a 'mailLocalAddress'
#    attribute matching the message's recipient address.  If exactly one
#    matching entry is found, MTAs MUST regard the message as being
#    addressed to the entity that is represented by the directory entry.
#
#    If multiple entries are found, the results of the lookup MUST be
#    treated as unsuccessful and should be handled by the MTA in some
#    locally-appropriate way, such as returning a DSN [10] to the sender.
#
#    If there is no match found by the above, MTAs SHOULD have the
#    capability of searching for the recipient domain against the
#    'mailLocalAddress' attribute using the "wildcard domain" address
#    "@<full-local-domain>" , e.g., "@example.org".  In other words, if
#    mail arrives for "someone@example.org", and there is no recipient
#    with that address specified as 'mailLocalAddress', then the recipient
#    with the wildcard domain address should receive the mail.
#
#    MTAs MAY do other searches but only after the above are done.
#
#    In short, the address attribute 'mailLocalAddress' may be used by an
#    LDAP entry to answer the question "what is/are this account's email
#    address(es)?"
#
#  4.3  Routing Attributes
#
attributetype ( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.18
           NAME 'mailHost'
           DESC 'fully-qualified hostname of the MTA that is the final
               SMTP destination of messages to this recipient'
           EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
           SYNTAX '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26{256}'
           SINGLE-VALUE
       )
#
#    The 'mailHost' attribute indicates which SMTP MTA considers the
#    recipient's mail to be locally handleable.  This information can be
#    used for routing, in that an intermediary MTA may take it to be the
#    destination for messages addressed to this recipient.  Normal mail
#    routing requirements (i.e., use of MX records [5]) apply to the
#    specified hostname unless overridden by local conventions.  In other
#    words, the mail should be sent to the specified host without changing
#    the recipient address.  The hostname is specified as a
#    fully-qualified DNS hostname with no trailing dot (e.g.,
#    "host42.example.com").
#
#    If the 'inetLocalMailRecipient' object class is present, the
#    'mailHost' attribute for each entry MAY contain a value.  If it does,
#    that value MUST be the fully qualified name of the server containing
#    the host MTA for this person.  If 'mailHost' is present then it MUST
#    be taken as the host for this user, and all mail to this user MUST be
#    routed to this machine.
#
attributetype ( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.47
           NAME 'mailRoutingAddress'
           DESC 'RFC 822 address to use when routing messages to
               the SMTP MTA of this recipient'
           EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
           SYNTAX '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26{256}'
           SINGLE-VALUE
       )
#
#    The 'mailRoutingAddress' attribute indicates a routing address for
#    the recipient.  The address MUST conform to the syntax of an
#    'addr-spec' in [3].  An intermediary MTA MUST use this information to
#    route the message to the MTA that handles mail for this recipient,
#    e.g., the envelope address MUST be rewritten to this value.  This is
#    useful in cases where, for a given recipient, the target MTA prefers
#    a particular address to appear as the recipient address in the SMTP
#    envelope.  'mailRoutingAddress' MAY be used as an alternative to
#    'mailHost', and is intended to have the same effect as 'mailHost'
#    except that 'mailRoutingAddress' is an address for rewriting the
#    envelope.  With 'mailHost', the envelope address either is not
#    rewritten, or is rewritten according to implementation-specific rules
#    and/or configuration.
#
#    If both 'mailHost' and 'mailRoutingAddress' are present, MTAs MUST
#    interpret it to mean that messages are to be routed to the host
#    indicated by 'mailHost', while rewriting the envelope as per
#    'mailRoutingAddress'.  In theory, there could be peculiar cases where
#    this is necessary, but this is not normally expected.
#
#    Absence of both 'mailHost' and 'mailRoutingAddress' MAY be considered
#    an error, unless "location-independent" recipient types are supported
#    by the various MTAs within the organization.  This would allow any
#    MTA in the organization to handle the processing of mail for, say, a
#    mailing list.  This presumes that the various MTAs all recognize the
#    recipient type in question, suggesting a need to standardize
#    recipient types that could be "location-independent".
#
#    In short, routing attributes may be used by an LDAP entry to answer
#    the question "how should MTAs route mail to this account?"
#    (analogous to using the sendmail "aliases" database for per-user
#    routing within an organization).  This is in contrast with
#    "forwarding"; forwarding and delivery options may be specified in an
#    LDAP entry to answer the question "what happens to mail once it
#    arrives at this account?", which may include forwarding to some other
#    account within or outside the organization (analogous to using the
#    sendmail ".forward" file).  Such options are outside the scope of the
#    'inetLocalMailRecipient' schema definition.
#
#    The following possibilities exist as a result of an LDAP lookup on an
#    address:
#
#         mailHost is     mailRoutingAddress is   Results in
#         -----------     ---------------------   ----------
#         set to a        set                     mail routed to
#         "local" host                            mailRoutingAddress
#
#         set to a        not set                 delivered to
#         "local" host                            original address
#
#         set to a        set                     relay to mailHost
#         remote host                             using mailRoutingAddress
#
#         set to a        not set                 original address
#         remote host                             relayed to mailHost
#
#         not set         set                     mail routed to
#                                                 mailRoutingAddress
#
#         not set         not set                 error or
#                                                 "location-independent"
#
#    The term "local" host above means the host specified is one that the
#    local (target) MTA considers to be a local delivery.  The local MTA
#    MAY rewrite the original address when mailRoutingAddress is not set
#    if local conventions warrant the change.
#
#  4.1  The inetLocalMailRecipient Object Class
#
objectclass ( 2.16.840.1.113730.3.2.147
           NAME 'inetLocalMailRecipient'
           SUP top
           AUXILIARY
           MAY ( mailLocalAddress $
               mailHost $ mailRoutingAddress
           )
       )
#
#    The 'inetLocalMailRecipient' object class signifies that the entry
#    represents an entity within the organization that can receive SMTP
#    mail, such as a mail user or a mailing list.  In any case of an entry
#    containing the 'inetLocalMailRecipient' object class, attributes
#    defined in this document MUST be interpreted as specified in this
#    document.
